> “Reading furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge; it is thinking that makes what we read ours.”
― John Locke 


My thoughts
* Notes should be written in Markdown or AsciiDoc. Much less context switching than Word
* Keep a daily agenda and branch off from there
* Notes should be constantly evolving.
* Notes should be revisted and written in your own words
* Evolutionary writing will strengthen synaptic pathways

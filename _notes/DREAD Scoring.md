<center>How bad is this vulnerability in comparison to others?</center>

DREAD is a process for calculating the risk of a vulnerability. While [[DREAD Scoring]] measures quantitative risk, [[FAIR Scoring]] measures qualitative risk.  


It is an acronym for: 
* **D**amage: how much damage can attacker cause?
* **R**eproducability: how easy is the vulnerability to reproduce?
* **E**xploitability: how easy is it to conduct a successful attack?
* **A**ffected users: what percentage of users does this affect?
* **D**iscoverability: how easy is this to discover?

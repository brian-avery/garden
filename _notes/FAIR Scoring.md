<center>How likely is this to be exploited and how big would the impact be?</center>

FAIR is a process for calculating the risk of a vulnerability as well as its impact to assets. While [[DREAD Scoring]] measures quantitative risk, [[FAIR Scoring]] measures qualitative risk. FAIR is easier to communicate to executives as it addresses the financial impact, but is complex to calculate. 


It is an acronym for: 
* **F**actor
* **A**nalysis
* **I**nformation
* **R**isk

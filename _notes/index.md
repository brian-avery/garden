Hi, I'm Brian Avery. I'm a [software engineer](/about) with a fascination for new technologies. My interests include [[Programming]], [[Security]], [[education]], [[cognitive science]], and [[machine learning]]. This website represents my [[digital garden]]. All documents here are representations of my notes and will evolve as I learn.

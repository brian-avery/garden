## Senior Distributed Software Developer at Verizon Labs
### February 2016 - May 2018

<hr />

### What is my role?

Verizon Labs is the research and development branch of Verizon. During my time here, I have focused on the development of microservice platforms for the internet of things. In this position, I have had the opportunity to work on several different projects, but in each project I worked on a small team using scrum with a Go, Kafka, Cassandra stack.

### Notable Projects
#### Data Analytics Platform
Developed the [Northstar](https://github.com/brian-avery/northstar) serverless computing platform that allowed users to write snippets to operate against data in an Apache Cassandra database. These snippets could either be triggered manually in a notebook or automatically using events. Events were captured using Kafka while scripts were executed in Spark. 

#### Natural Language Chat Bot

#### IoT Device Communication Platform

#### Technologies Used

Go, Cassandra, Kafka, Microsoft Linguistic Services, Angular 2, Typescript

## Software Developer II, Oracle (formerly Acme Packet) 
### July 2012 - February 2016

<hr />

### What was my role?
At Oracle, I was on a team developing the session border controller. For those who don't know, a session border controller is a device that sits on the edge of a telephone service provider's network and handles security, session management, and routing for phone calls. I worked as a sustaining software engineer, taking customer reported defects, reproducing them, fixing them, and testing them. This was on a huge C++ code base that got compiled to the firmware that ran on the SBCs.
### Notable Projects
#### SNMP SIP, ENUM Statistics Feature on Session Border Controller 
One of my projects was to add functionality to report performance statistics for SIP and ENUM traffic. My responsibilities included developing a functional specification from a customer requirements document, developing code, and testing the feature before passing it onto QA for further evaluation.
#### Resource Management System
At Oracle, on top of my job responsibilities, I was constantly watching for ways to optimize our development process. I initiated a project to redesign an internal hardware reservation and inventory system, taking multiple redundant data sources and hardware systems and combining them into one common interface. This new system used the AngularJS framework, PHP, and a MySQL database with a RESTful API to connect the layers. Python scripts were used to communicate with other network devices.
#### Technologies Used
C, C++, AngularJS, PHP, MySQL, Python, VxWorks, Linux
## Laboratory Technician, Exacom Inc, Concord NH
### Oct 2008 - May 2012

<hr />

### What was my role?
Exacom's primary product is a phone/radio recording and playback solution used primarily in the government and private sector industries. My responsibilities were as varied as they were many. I setup servers with our product from the installation of the windows operating system to running and processing telephone calls ready to be shipped. I developed configuration and other utilities for use in the product. I developed recording solutions to process various communication types. I troubleshooted customer systems. You get the idea. At the same time that I was employed at Exacom, I was busy as a full time student working on my associates at NHTI and then my bachelors at UNH.
